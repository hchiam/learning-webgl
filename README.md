# Learning WebGL

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Tutorials: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial> and <https://webglfundamentals.org>

Use your GPU to draw/animate 2D and 3D stuff in a `<canvas>`. More math-y 3D stuff (compared to just using the `canvas` API).

Examples: <https://github.com/mdn/webgl-examples/tree/gh-pages/tutorial>

`three.js` is a framework that makes it easier to build 3D apps and games by encapsulating WebGL: <https://threejs.org>
